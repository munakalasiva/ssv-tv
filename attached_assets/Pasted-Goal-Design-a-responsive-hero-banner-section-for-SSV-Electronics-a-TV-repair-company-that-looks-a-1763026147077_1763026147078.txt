Goal:
Design a responsive hero banner section for SSV Electronics (a TV repair company) that looks and behaves exactly like the hero section of Shiftwave.com.

Desktop Layout:

Use a max-width of 1250px container (.container { max-width: 1250px; margin: 0 auto; }).

Background: auto-playing video (TV technician repairing a TV) that covers full width and height, with dark overlay for text visibility (rgba(0,0,0,0.5)).

Overlay content (center-left):

Main heading: “Expert TV Repairs with Reliable Warranty Support”

Subtext: “Fast, affordable, and warranty-backed repair services for all TV brands — handled by certified professionals.”

Two buttons:

Primary (Red): “Book a Repair”

Secondary (Outline): “Our Services →”

Right side: 4 vertically stacked red statistic cards, similar to Shiftwave’s:

10+ Years Experience

5000+ Happy Customers

100% Satisfaction Rate

50+ Areas Covered

Each card should have:

Background: solid red (#D71920)

Text: white, bold, centered

Border radius: 12px

Soft box-shadow

Mobile Layout (Key Requirement):

The hero section must look exactly like Shiftwave.com mobile view:

The video background should scale and crop intelligently (use object-fit: cover;) and maintain aspect ratio.

Text should move on top of the video, centered, with adequate padding.

Buttons should stack vertically below the text.

The red statistic cards should appear below the hero video, in a full-width horizontal scroll or stacked vertically (auto-adjusting).

The cards should have consistent spacing and responsive font sizes.

All text and elements should remain readable and visually balanced.

Use fluid typography (e.g., clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2.5rem)) for headings.

Add smooth entrance animations like Shiftwave (fade-in or slide-up).

Additional Requirements:

Apply padding:

Desktop: padding: 0 2rem;

Mobile: padding: 0 1rem;

Navbar and “Book a Repair” button styling should match Shiftwave’s red tone and rounded corners.

Maintain clean white spacing and subtle drop shadows.

Floating social icons on the right side (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) that stay visible.

Use font family: “Poppins” or “Inter”.

Color Palette:

Primary Red: #D71920

Secondary Navy: #001F3F

White Text: #FFFFFF

Light Gray for hover states: #F4F4F4

Deliverables:

Fully responsive hero section (desktop + tablet + mobile).

Video background with proper scaling and overlay.

Adaptive typography and spacing.

Modern and minimal look identical to Shiftwave’s hero banner.
